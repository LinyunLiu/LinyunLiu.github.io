Dear Recruiting Team:

I am writing to express my interest and excitement in the posted opening for the part-time Retail Sales Associate at Best Buy. While looking for a part-time job as a student, I realized that I love being surrounded by technologies, especially computers, and I am always so passionate sharing my knowledge of technologies with others. Eventually, working at one of my most visited stores, Best Buy, has finally come into my mind.

While completing my degree in computing science and film studies. I am also motivated to contribute to the society with my skills. I believe that working at Best Buy is a great opportunity for me to apply what I have learnt and what I will be learning to help customers make decision while giving them necessary insights to help them understand technologies. It gives me significant satisfaction and self-achievement. As a young individual, I hope I can explore my potentials and possibilities to gain valuable experiences, to challenge my introverted personality, independent and communication skills.

I am looking forward to hearing from you and thank you very much for reading!

Sincerely,
Linyun Liu</textarea>
